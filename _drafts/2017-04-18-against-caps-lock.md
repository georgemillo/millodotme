If you could go back in time and eliminate one person from history, who would it be? For me it's a toss-up between Hitler, Katy Perry, and the guy who invented the Caps Lock key.

In my twenty-six years on this planet, I have spent a frankly embarrassing amount of time sat in front of a computer screen. I built my first website when I was 10 (it was about Pok√©mon), assembled my own PC out of spare parts when I was 12, wasted basically my entire teenage years playing videogames, started a computer science degree at 21, dropped out of it a year later and have been working professionally with computers ever since (I'm 26 now). In an average week I probably spend fifty to sixty hours sat at a desk, typing. By the most conservative estimate, I've probably spent 10,000 hours using a keyboard in the last five years alone. The total for my entire life could be three or four times that number.

In tens of thousands of hours spent using a QWERTY keyboard, I'm not sure that there has been one time, at all, not once even *ever*, that I have had a legitimate use for the Caps Lock key. There have, on the hand, been approximately five thousand times where I pressed it accidentally. This key serves no purpose except to slow people down, raise tempers in online comment threads, and contribute ever more to the global rise in rates of carpal tunnel syndrome.

Yes, I know there are still some Philistines out there who don't know how to use the Shift key. I've seen it with my own eyes. Caps lock on... letter... caps lock off. It astonishes me that such primitive beasts are able to function in the twenty-first century.

Actually, my ex-girlfriend used to type like that. (Or maybe she still does.) I'm not saying that that's the main reason why she's now my ex-girlfriend, but it didn't help her case.

Sometimes I wonder what the total economic cost of this key is. How many billions are frittered away every year by people wasting time with this unnecessary key? It's the technological equivalent of the *-ough* suffix in English spelling. It's only purpose is to annoy.

But fear not! There's hope. I actually discovered a year or two ago that you're not enslaved to the whims of whichever dumbass still hasn't realised that the Caps Lock key is a terrible idea. On a Mac, it's simple to make things more sensible. The precise steps may vary for different versions of OS X, since Apple have a habit of randomly changing their configuration options for no reason, but here's how it works on El Capitan:

1. Open System Preferences
2. Go to 'Keyboard'
3. Click 'Modifier Keys'
4. Change the function of the 'Caps Lock' key to something more sensible.

Success! You're now free from the Caps Lock tyranny. I've got my own one bound to 'Ctrl', since programmers have far more use for that key than the average Macaholic, and who wants to keep bending their poor left pinky all the way down like that? But you might have more success with another key.

Anyway, now that I've freed myself from the evil clutches of Caps Lock, I suppose it's now time to go kill Katy Perry. Future generations will thank me.
