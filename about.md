I'm a `<%= Date.today.year - 1990 %>` year-old coder from England who primarily works with Ruby on Rails. This blog is where I muse about Rails, Ruby, web development, and other code-related matters.

I can also be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/georgemillo), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/georgemillo), [my other (non-tech) blog](http://georgemillo.com), and in all good bookstores.

Want to work with me? Just [send an email](mailto:{{site.email}}).
