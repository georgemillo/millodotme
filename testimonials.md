Here's what some of my former clients have to say about me:

  <p>“George is brilliant, multi-faceted, curious, and conscientious in a way that normally comes after only a decade’s-worth of extra mistakes — mistakes I know he’s been unable to log at his young age.  I’d enthusiastically work with him again on any task requiring brains and gumption.”</p>

  <p>“George is detail-oriented and a pleasure to work with. His code is elegant and easy to understand. We worked side by side for 10 months and our app is much better for it: from performance, to test coverage, to general style. I look forward to working with him again in the future.”</p>

    “My company hired George to complete a membership site for us, and were extremely impressed with the results. The site perfectly matched all our specs, and the final price came very close to what was originally quoted at the beginning of the project. George was easy to get in touch with, and provided regular updates on how the work was coming along. We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend his services to anyone looking for an experienced Rails developer.”
